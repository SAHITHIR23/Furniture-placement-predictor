# AI-Powered Furniture Placement Predictor

 **AI model for structured 2D layout generation** that predicts the optimal position (X, Y) for furniture placement in a given room.

---

## Overview
This project uses **TensorFlow, Gradio, and Google Colab** to create an interactive AI-based **furniture placement predictor**.

The model takes three inputs:
- **Room Width**
- **Room Height**
- **Furniture Size**

It then predicts the best **(X, Y)** position for the furniture.
